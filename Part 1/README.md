# How Backpropagation Works 

## Introduction

In the previous section, we learned about the forward pass, which is the first step in training a neural network. In this section, we'll focus on the second step: the backward pass. The backward pass is the process of updating the weights of the neural network in order to minimize the loss function. This process is also known as backpropagation.

You will be able to:

- Understand and explain the process of backpropagation
- Understand and explain the role of the loss function in backpropagation
